# Progressive Web Apps on Windows

With Progressive Web Apps (or *PWAs*), you dont have to decide between using open web technologies for cross-platform interoperability and providing your users with a native app-like experience customized for their particular device. That's because PWAs are just websites that are [*progressively enhanced*]() to function like native apps on supporting platforms. The qualities of a PWA combine the best of the web and native apps.

:-------------- | :-------------
**Discoverable** | 
**Installable** | 
**Linkable** | 
**Re-engageable** | 
**Network Independent** | 
**Progressive** | 
**Responsive** | 
**Safe** | 

By building (or converting your existing web app as) a PWA, you can better engage your existing audience with push notifications and offline/low-network support. At the same time, you can continue building your audience on the open web, as users discover your PWA through search and link-sharing.

You can also grow your audience by distributing your PWA through the Microsoft Store. TODO: Windows 10 install base. What's more PWAs have access to Windows S.

PWAs running on Windows 10 have access (with the end-user permission) to native (Windows Runtime, or *WinRT*) APIs, such as for device camera, calendar, and speech interaction.  

## PWA prerequisites
  - manifest
  - https
  - service worker

  - installation, testing
  - Bing indexing / Store support
  - Packaged web apps, HWAs explainer
